6. Voting Rights: Class A shares entitle the holder to vote on specific matters defined by the bylaws, including matters related to the sale, dissolution, lease allocation, and pricing of property owned by Pando.

### Section 3. Class B Investor Shares

1. Minimum: No minimum requirement.
2. Maximum: No maximum limit.
3. Initial Issuance: Upon purchasing a property, the number of Class B shares created will be equal to the total amount of dollars contributed towards the purchase, including the down payment, closing fees, and related costs (excluding the mortgage loan). These Class B shares will be distributed proportionally to individuals based on their financial contributions, with each dollar contributed earning one Class B share.
4. Additional Issuance:  Pando may create and issue additional Class B shares according to the procedures outlined in the bylaws.
5. Transferability: Class B shares can be transferred according to the following process. 
      1. Initiation of Sale: A Class B shareholder may initiate a sale by notifying a member of the board of directors of their intention to sell their shares. Subsequently, the board of directors shall convene a meeting in accordance with the bylaws to inform all existing Class A shareholders of the intent to sell.
      2. Purchasing Plan Approval: Following the notification, Class A shareholders shall discuss and vote on a purchasing plan for the Class B shares at a meeting called in accordance with the bylaws. The purchasing plan, which requires approval by a two-thirds majority of Class A shareholders, shall include one or multiple paths outlined below:
         1. Buyback by Pando: The cooperative purchases all or some of the Class B shares using existing funds from the cooperative's bank account. Upon purchase, the shares are considered void and hold no value upon liquidation of any property. The cooperative may reissue the shares according to the Class B additional issuance clause.
         2. Gradual Purchase Plan: Pando agrees to purchase all or some of the class B shares gradually using funds from the cooperative's bank account over an agreed-upon rate and timeline.  Upon purchase, the purchased shares are considered void and hold no value upon liquidation of any property. The cooperative may reissue these shares according to the Class B additional issuance clause. Any remaining unpurchased Class B shares retain their issued status and receive compensation if a sale occurs before their purchase.
         3. Refinancing Option: Pando agrees to refinance the mortgage, incorporating the necessary amount to buy out the Class B shares into the refinanced loan. The shares are purchased upon completion of the refinancing process. After the purchase, the shares are considered void and hold no value upon liquidation of any property. The cooperative may reissue the shares according to the Class B additional issuance clause.
         4. Purchase by Class A Shareholders: One or multiple existing Class A shareholders have the option to purchase the Class B shares. In case of multiple purchasers, the shares are divided equally among them, up to their respective desired purchase amounts. The transfer of shares is completed directly, following the process specified in the bylaws.
         5. Purchase by Non-Class A Shareholders: The Class B shares may be purchased by non-Class A shareholders. The transfer of shares is completed directly, following the process specified in the bylaws.
6. Voting Rights: Individuals who have been issued Class B shares are entitled to vote on matters related to the sale of the property, dissolution of Pando, and other matters specified in the bylaws. Whenever a Class B shareholder vote is held, each Class B shareholder receives one vote per one Class B share that they own. Non-issued Class B shares do not entitle an individual to any voting rights. 
7. Monetary Value: The monetary value of a single Class B share is determined by the formula [total property value of all property owned by Pando]/[number of issued Class B shares]. For details on the methodology used to determine the property value of all property owned by Pando, please refer to the dedicated section in the bylaws. Non-issued Class B shares have no monetary value.
